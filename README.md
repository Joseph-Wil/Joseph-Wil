## About me
Hi there ðŸ‘‹. My name is Joseph Terrado. I am currently a student studying web development in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

I have always been intrigued on how video games, apps and websites work. Hence, why I am studying web development. My goal is to learn the foundations and develop the skills to possibly create or help create them in the future.
So far, I've learned coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using VS Code as my editor. I'm developing my knowledge in those fields and working to improve them.
